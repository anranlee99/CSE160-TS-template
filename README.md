# CSE160-TS-template

## About
Vanilla js hard to use. Refreshing is annoying. Use this if you want.

### Tips
Just code in [`asg0.ts`](asg0.ts) and [`lib/cuon-matrix-cse160.ts`](lib/cuon-matrix-cse160.ts).

I haven't figured out how to update the types dynamically.

### How To 
fork/clone this repo. 
```
npm i
```
will install typescript and vite 
<br>
<br>
```
npm run dev 
```
this should refreh automatically when you update the code


```
npm run build
```

this will make your vanilla js files for submission + serve the script page

```
npm run submit
```
this will run build and also zip up your submission
